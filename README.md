# H1 Anki Deck Generator

*A huge thanks to Otavio Ehrenberger for his [post](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/supercharged-studying-with-python-anki-chatgpt/) which I used as inspiration to develop this solution, and of course to the Genanki's team for their [library](https://github.com/kerrickstaley/genanki)*

## What is this?

This is a Anki deck generator, the idea is that you clon this repository and modify the main.py file to generate your own deck.

## How to use it?

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the requirements
3. Modify the main.py file so you include the model and cards for your deck
4. Run the main.py file
5. Import the deck in Anki


## Ideas to improve it

1. Include a prompt to ask the user for the model and cards so that you can do this from your terminal
2. Include a way to generate the deck from different formats like txt, csv, json, xlsx, etc.
3. Add support to create cards with images
4. Add suport to create cards with sounds
5. Incorporate a database (best option imo: sqllite) to store the decks, cards and models.
